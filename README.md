# spot-check-api
Minimal API layer between Surfline and requesting device. Useful for minifying the bloated data from Surfline's API for consumption on a memory-constrained device.

Currently serving only hard-coded info strings (i.e. "8/11 1-3ft at 6:00, 2-3ft at 12:00, 1-2ft at 18:00"). Feel free to open an issue or pull request if you'd like to add the option to return the minified JSON bundles too.
